# World_Weather_Analysis

The purpose of this project is to provide a vacation seeker with a means of filtering destination by temperatures and then providing them with the closest hotel to their destination and a map with or without directions of they choose multiple destinations.

This was carried out in three broad steps:
- Collect weather data (current conditions)
- Create a simple input and filter destinations based on this input. Then determine the closest hotel.
- Create a map with driving directions with popup markers providing snapshot information.

In slightly more detail:
- approx. random numbers were generated for longitude and latitude.
- Using an API, these were associated with the nearest city.
- Using an API, weather conditions for each were determined.
- After sorting, a plug-in and API were used to create maps.
